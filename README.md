# Advice
A simple Python program that will give useful advice on every run. It uses [adviceslip](https://adviceslip.com/) API to retrieve the advice then playing Advice from the terminal.

I have retrieved the json content recieved from API then played through the terminal by [mPlayer](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mplayer)
